XML DOM Introduction
====================

The **XML DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for XML documents. It represents the structure of an XML document as a tree, where each node represents part of the document (such as an element, attribute, or text). It allows programs to manipulate XML data dynamically, such as reading, modifying, and adding elements.

**Key Features:**
- Provides a tree-like structure for XML documents.
- Allows for dynamic changes to the document structure.
- Supports language-independent access, commonly used with JavaScript.
